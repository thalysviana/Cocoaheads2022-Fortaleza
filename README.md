# Cocoaheads2022-Fortaleza

## Description üßê
In this project we're going to help Hogwarts' students in adding unit tests to an iOS app (Devs ü§ù Wizards). The app currently shows information about characters from the Harry Potter saga. They told us they are concerned about the imminent threats from the dark forces, and asked for our help to add unit tests to protect hogwarts against the resurgent evil, but there's one caveat, we must use ~magic~ [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) to build it ü™Ñ

## More info ‚Ñπ
This repo has two projects. One called **_HPSampleStarter_** and another one called **_HPSampleFinal_**. They are pretty much the same, the only difference is that
the first one is not yet finished. Just in case you want to play with it and try yourself some Sourcery üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The latter is the finalized version of it. Feel free
to use as a guidance project.
