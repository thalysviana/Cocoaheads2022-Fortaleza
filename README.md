# Cocoaheads2022-Fortaleza

## Description üßê
In this project we're going to help Hogwarts' students in unit testing an iOS app (Dev ü§ù Wizards). This app contains information about characters
from the Harry Potter saga, but there's one caveat, we must use ~magic~ [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) to build it ü™Ñ

## Initial Set up ‚öôÔ∏è

Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/thalysviana/Cocoaheads2022-Fortaleza.git
```

Install Sourcery

```
brew install sourcery
```
> You can also use any of the other [installation methods](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery#installation) described in the Sourcery repo

## More info ‚Ñπ
This repo has two projects. One called **_HPSampleStarter_** and another one called **_HPSampleFinal_**. They are pretty much the same, the only difference is that
the first one is not yet finished. Just in case you want to play with it and try yourself some Sourcery üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The latter is the finalized version of it. Feel free
to use as a guidance project.
